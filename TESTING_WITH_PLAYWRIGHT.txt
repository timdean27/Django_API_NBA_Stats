browser.new_context() 

In Playwright, the browser.new_context() method is used to create a new browser context. 
A browser context is essentially a new, isolated environment within the same browser instance. 
Each context operates independently, meaning that pages in different contexts do not share cookies, cache, or other session data.
Security: Since contexts are isolated, they provide a secure environment to test different applications or states without data leakage.
