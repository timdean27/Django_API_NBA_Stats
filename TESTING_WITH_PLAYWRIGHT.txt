Run the Tests: Execute pytest in the terminal:
pip install pytest
type into terminal:
pytest

How pytest Discovers and Runs Tests:
File Naming Conventions:

pytest looks for files that start with test_ or end with _test.py. For example, test_api.py, api_tests.py, or test_api_tests.py would all be discovered by pytest.
Since your file is named api_tests.py, it matches the pattern of ending with _test.py, so pytest will include it in its test discovery.
Function Naming Conventions:

pytest looks for functions that start with test_ within these files. Functions like test_home_page(), test_player_list(), and test_player_detail() in your api_tests.py file will be automatically recognized as test functions.
Test Discovery Process:

When you run the pytest command in the terminal, pytest searches through the current directory (and subdirectories) for files that match the naming convention.
It collects all the test functions within those files and executes them.

we can run script to get print statments

browser.new_context() 

In Playwright, the browser.new_context() method is used to create a new browser context. 
A browser context is essentially a new, isolated environment within the same browser instance. 
Each context operates independently, meaning that pages in different contexts do not share cookies, cache, or other session data.
Security: Since contexts are isolated, they provide a secure environment to test different applications or states without data leakage.
